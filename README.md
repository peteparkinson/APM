Art Projects Manager, website

Senior project for DeVry graduating class September 2020.

This is a translation of the Art Projects Manager that was written in Java (repository on this account)
except this version is in HTML, JS, and CSS.  The two should be functionally identical, except the web
version will be launched from a browser.

Currently using Node.js for server side with Express framework.
