# Art Projects Manager

This program is my senior project at DeVry, graduating class September 2020.
It's intended to facilitate record keeping and inventory control for a small arts and crafts business.
Below, there's a list of features, a description for how the program should be used, and a technical explanation of construction.


# Features
### Project Tracking

The "project" is composed of "materials"

This is a translation of the Art Projects Manager that was written in Java (repository on this account) except this version is in HTML, JS, and CSS. The two should be functionally identical, except the web version will be launched from a browser.

Currently using Node.js for server side with Express framework.

### Proof of Concept

Written in Java using swing, this program served as a demo to the client.
